# heroes-app

The Heroes App. Allows you to add information about your favourite heroes.
What started off looking like a fancier todolist has turned into a application that actually modifies data (data which is stored in a SQLite3 database) and applies CRUD operations to said data. It does these operations through an API called the heroes API!

This app is just one piece of a larger microservice that I hope to updated and expand.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

note: This project requires other backend services that are independent applications. To find these services look for the <strong>MyHeroesMicroservice</strong> repository.
